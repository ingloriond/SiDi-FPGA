# EP994A - TI99/4A clone for MiSTica / SiDi

Usage - Put *.rbf file and TI994A.rom into your SD.

## Cart loading

Cartridges can have .g (GROM), .c and .d parts. They could be auto-detected from the file extension,
or you must choose the appropriate menu item to load the correct type, if the extension is .bin.

If there's a .d part, load it last!

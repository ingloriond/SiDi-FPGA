### CART/PRG loading
CRT and PRG files usually has the load address in the first two bytes. If a particular file
doesn't contain this address, you can load it to the default $a000 via choosing
'CRT with load address: No' option in the OSD menu. Loading a cart to the $a000 location
will auto-reset the core, so it'll start automatically. If you have a multi-part cartridge,
then first load the part which doesn't load to $a000. Also don't forget to enable 8k ROM
option for cartrdiges!

### RAM expansions

The core supports from the orginal unexpanded (5k RAM) machine to a fully extended one
(total of 40k RAM). Unfortunately not all games supports all expansion modes, 
so you have to figure out what a particular game requires.

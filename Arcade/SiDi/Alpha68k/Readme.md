The intent for this core is to be a 1:1 playable implementation of [Alpha Denshi M68000 (ALPHA68K96V based) arcade hardware](http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=884).

Currently in beta state, this core is in active development by [Darren Olafson](https://twitter.com/Darren__O) with assistance from [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17). Please consider showing support for this and future projects via [Darren's Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/darreno) and [atrac17's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/atrac17). While it isn't necessary, it's greatly appreciated.

FPGA implementation has been verified against schematics for Sky Adventure. PCB measurements taken from Gang Wars (ALPHA-68K96V) and Sky Soldiers (ALPHA-96KII).

MiST port, new SDRAM controller, some fixes and enhancements by [Gyorgy Szombathelyi](https://github.com/gyurco) and [Gehstock](https://github.com/Gehstock).

The intent for this core is to be a 1:1 playable implementation of ["Prehistoric Isle in 1930" SNK M68000 hardware](http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=888&gid=18603#18603).

This core is in active development by [Darren Olafson](https://twitter.com/Darren__O) with assistance from [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17). Please consider showing support for this and future projects via [Darren's Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/darreno) and [atrac17's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/atrac17). While it isn't necessary, it's greatly appreciated.

FPGA implementation is loosely based on MAME source and will be verified against an authentic SNK Prehistoric Isle in 1930 PCB.

MiST port, new SDRAM controller, clocking and other fixes, graphics rewrite by [Gyorgy Szombathelyi](https://github.com/gyurco) and [Gehstock](https://github.com/Gehstock).

## Installation
Place TSConf.ROM, TSConf.R01 and RBF file from [release](release/) folder into root of SD card.

Also you need to place TSConf.VHD file with  Wild Commander and your games and demos. [There is](release/) example VHD to start with. \
As alternative to VHD you can just unzip Wild Commander into root of your FAT32-formatted SD card.

By default, if everything is done right, Wild Commander will be loaded where you can choose software to start.


## Usage
Original TSConf F12 key (reset) is transferred to F11. \
To enter BASIC press Shift+F11. \
To enter TS-BIOS Setup Utility press Ctrl+F11. By default these setting are volatile and lost after MiST reset. To save them - open OSD menu (with F12 key) and tap "Save NVRAM settings".

firmware_150715_r1207
=====================

Added support for "indirect SD card" for C64/C1541 implementation.

This is useful for cores that expect to read data directly from
non-FAT formatted SD cards. The C64/C1541 expects to have such kind of
access. This firmware allows to redirect these accesses into files
stored on SD card.
